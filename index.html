		  <p><strong>No.</strong> <br> It would be weird if I wrote this question and there wasn't! If you look north west you'll see a small turquoise triangle. This is called Flank II, it was made in 1978 by New York sculpture artist Mia Westerlund Roosen. It was recently restored by the artist because of corrosion over 30 years. Here's a video with a couple interviews  from the artist and gallery director Hafthor Ingvason. </p>

You’ll probably also notice that this building is made entirely of concrete. Because of this, it was the least energy efficient building on campus. Ironic. That is until they covered the roof in solar panels to make the building more energy neutral. </p>
