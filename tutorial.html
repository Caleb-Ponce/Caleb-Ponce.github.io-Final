    <ol>
        <li>Have evryone in your party meet up in the same place on campus. this can be anywhere on campus as there are sculptures everywhere. maybe start in the middle and split up, or start at an edge and work your way across!</li>
        <li>Every player will need to get their own bingo card so make sure you all have your own phones. (WARNING: Do not refresh the page with your bingo card. if you do the card will reset and you'll have to start over.) </li>
        <li>Once everyone has their own card, you are ready to begin!</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>The Proof</h1>
    <p id="Proof">Now theres no way for you to prove that you actually went to each sculpture on this website. So you'll have to do that yourself! For every sculpture you mark on your bingo card, take a picture of yourself with the sculpture in it. you can take pictures solo</p>
